**Project Objective**: To provide archivists with a human-readable specification and interface for managing complex real world collections in digital space.

**Description**: Arcdown is a web-based, multi-lingual, multi-tool focused on format transpiling, API management, and version control, designed to lower the data management barrier-to-entry for archivists by giving them no/lo-code options for creating, maintaining, and sharing catalogues of real world objects. Arcdown is composed of a backend server for API/CRUD operations, a frontend client for managing archives, and a human-readable specification for archive objects inspired by Markdown. 

**Technology Stack**: Arcdown is built using a MERN stack; MongoDB for document database, Express.js as server-side framework, React.js as client-side framework, and Node.js as JavaScript server platform.

**Status**: Development is currently in the prototype stage. Documentation is being compiled and a [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) will be forthcoming.
